# Project: Global Layoffs

## Data Cleaning, Exploration & Analysis

This project was my attempt to conduct a comprehensive data cleaning and exploration project focused on global layoffs, transforming a raw, unstructured dataset into a reliable resource for insightful analysis

## Data Cleaning & Structuring

The initial phase involved converting disorganized data into a structured, analysis-ready format. Here is how I tackled this:

* Deduplication: Identified and removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
  
* Data Aggregation: Combined data from multiple sources such as news articles, company reports, and industry publications to ensure diverse sector and regional coverage.

* Handling Missing Values: Applied suitable imputation methods or removed records with insufficient information.

* Standardization: Unified formats for dates, numeric values, and categorical fields to maintain consistency.

* Error Correction: Cross-referenced data with trusted sources to correct anomalies and inaccuracies.

* Validation: Ensured overall accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the final dataset.

The result was a high-quality dataset, primed for analysis and capable of supporting meaningful insights into global layoff trends.

## Data Exploration & Analysis

With a clean dataset in place, I conducted an in-depth exploration to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in global layoffs. Highlights of the analysis include:

* Peak Layoffs: Identified the largest layoff events by total layoffs and percentage of workforce affected, focusing particularly on cases involving 100% layoffs.

* Company-Level Insights: Aggregated layoffs by company to highlight the most impacted organizations, and ranked them by total layoffs and funding raised.

* Temporal Trends: Analyzed layoffs over time by day, month, and year to reveal patterns and cyclical behaviors.

* Sector & Geographic Impact: Broke down layoffs by industry and country to determine which sectors and regions were most affected.

* Company Stage Analysis: Compared layoffs across company stages (e.g., startup, growth, public) to assess vulnerability.

* Rolling Totals: Used rolling monthly totals to visualize cumulative trends and inflection points.

* Yearly Rankings: Ranked companies by layoff volume within each year, spotlighting the top five for deeper insight.

This end-to-end project provided a robust foundation for understanding workforce changes at a global scale. It also enabled data-driven storytelling and informed decision-making around employment trends, economic shifts, and sector performance.
